# Perception of Big Pharma

## Overview
This project aims to evaluate and assess public sentiment regarding the perception of big pharma companies on various media platforms. It is a repurposed casual project that was influenced
by research I did in high school regarding anti-vaccination and pro-vaccination movements during the pandemic. Some of the platforms studied include X (Twitter), the New York Times, Facebook,
and more.
